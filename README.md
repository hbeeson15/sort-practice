# sort-practice
Compares two sorts: quicksort and merge sort
This program was written in NetBeans IDE 8.2. It requires JDK 8 to run. Input and output files should be passed in as command line
arguments.

Only one of the calls to a sort is not commented out in Main. This was to keep the output as simple and easy to read as possible. Calls 
to the other sorts are written but just need to be un-commented.
